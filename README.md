Babagaboosh GUI

Babagaboosh GUI is an easy-to-use implementation of Doug Doug's Babagaboosh project, built using Godot Engine 4.2.1 and C#. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for experimenting with the concepts introduced by Doug Doug in his entertaining videos.

Note: This project is still in active development and may contain bugs. It is a work in progress, and an official release will be made once the application is feature-complete. Contributions are not being accepted at this stage due to the heavy development process.
